There was no one to validate if what I was doing was correct. This was an amazing time, where I vastly expanded my knowledge in every aspect of a website.

I have a deep understanding of the DevOps philosophy and have successfully implemented it in my previous roles.
Infrastructure Automation:
One of the core aspects of my experience is infrastructure automation. By utilizing Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code tool, I have been able to provision and manage infrastructure resources across various cloud platforms. Terraform enables me to define infrastructure as code, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments. With Terraform, I have streamlined the process of spinning up and tearing down infrastructure, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.
IaC and DevOps:
Furthermore, I have a deep understanding of the DevOps philosophy and have successfully integrated it into my previous roles. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) plays a pivotal role in DevOps practices, allowing teams to version, test, and deploy infrastructure changes in a controlled manner. By adopting IaC principles, I have improved the reliability and scalability of infrastructure deployments, while also promoting collaboration and traceability within cross-functional teams.
Istio Service Mesh:
In addition to infrastructure automation, I have hands-on experience with Istio, a powerful service mesh technology. Istio provides a layer of observability, security, and traffic management for microservices-based architectures. With Istio, I have successfully implemented advanced routing and load balancing strategies, as well as implemented fault tolerance and circuit-breaking mechanisms. This ensures high availability and resiliency for distributed systems.
Networking:
Another crucial aspect of my experience lies in networking. I have worked extensively with various networking technologies to establish secure and reliable communication between components within distributed systems. By leveraging networking concepts such as virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and security groups, I have built robust and scalable network architectures for cloud-based applications. Additionally, I have implemented network policies and access controls to enhance security and protect sensitive data.
Software Release Process and CI/CD:
Moreover, I have a strong background in the software release process and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. By introducing automation across all technology stacks, I have significantly improved release cycles, reducing the time from development to production. With the integration of tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and Kubernetes, I have established efficient pipelines that automate building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring rapid and reliable software releases.');

For example, I facilitated the market entry of one such company into more than 10 regulated markets across North America, Latin America and Europe by:
- conducting due diligence on licencing requirements and facilitating the licence application process with various regulators;
- identifying applicable product requirements from regulatory guidance documents and distilling those into actionable points for IT (infrastructure-related requirements) and development (development-related requirements) teams;
- coordinating with C-level stakeholders on a daily basis on strategic issues such as budgeting, auditing, regulatory approvals etc.;
- spearheading the certification function for all product verticals, including negotiating  and putting in place the contractual framework with a number of accredited testing houses;
